These are my assignments from [Dr. Nico]'s Operating Systems course.

If you are a computing student at Cal Poly who has not yet taken CPE 453, do
not read this.

If you are a non-computing student at Cal Poly who might transfer to a
computing major, do not read this.

If you are a student at another school who might transfer to Cal Poly, do not
read this.

If you are a potential student of Cal Poly, do not read this.

Otherwise, feel free to poke around.
