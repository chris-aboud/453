`make` builds malloc.o; there is a `libmalloc.a` task as well, if you'd like
it.

Running the simple included test program (`make test`) segfaults, which is a
bad sign, since it only calls malloc and free one time each.  So, I don't
expect you'll be able to get this to do much of anything useful.

I didn't put nearly enough time into this program, in large part because I kept
pushing back lab 1 due to my reluctance to work again in C. :)  Late days would
be of no use, however, since I wouldn't be able to work on it until Monday, so
I'll take the grade I get.
