Since I'm compiling with the c89 standard (to ensure no // comments), I had to
change the provided macros to use `__asm__` instead of `asm`.  I also added
SetBP and GetBP macros analogous to SetSP and SetBP for the purposes of
debugging.

Although my simple tests and numbers work, snakes segfaults; my suspicion is
this is caused by a segfault in the scheduler part of the code, but I haven't
looked into it.
